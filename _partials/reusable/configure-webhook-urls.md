## Configure your webhook URLs

There are at least two webhooks you must configure:

* Message Status webhook
* Inbound Message webhook

When messages status updates are generated, such as `delivered`, `rejected` or `accepted`, callbacks will be received on the _Message Status_ webhook URL.

When an inbound message is received, a callback with message payload is invoked on the _Inbound Message_ webhook URL.

> **IMPORTANT:** Both webhook URLs should be configured. At the very least your webhook handlers should return 200 responses for both Inbound Message and Message Status callbacks. This ensures potential [callback queuing](#callback-queue) issues are avoided.

### To configure the webhook URLs

1. If you have already [created an application](/messages/code-snippets/create-an-application), but not yet configured your webhooks, go to [Your Applications](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications) and select the application to configure.

2. Click **Edit** to modify the application's webhook URLs.

3. In the Messages capabilities section, enter your webhook URLs in the fields labeled **Status URL** and **Inbound URL**.

The values you enter for webhook URLs depends on where your webhook server is located. For example:

Webhook | URL
---|---
Status URL | `https://www.example.com/webhooks/message-status`
Inbound URL | `https://www.example.com/webhooks/inbound-message`

> **NOTE:** The default method of `POST` should be used for both of the webhook URLs.

### Inbound SMS webhooks

Messages API does not support inbound SMS message and SMS delivery receipt callbacks via the application-specific webhooks described in the previous section. In order to receive callbacks for SMS message and SMS delivery receipts you need to set the [account-level webhooks for SMS](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings).

### Testing locally via Ngrok

If you want to test your application locally you can use Ngrok.

See our information on [Using Ngrok for local development](/tools/ngrok)

If using Ngrok in this manner you would use the Ngrok URLs for your webhook URLs:

* `https://abcdef1.ngrok.io/webhooks/inbound-message`
* `https://abcdef1.ngrok.io/webhooks/message-status`

### Webhook queue

Please note that webhooks emanating from Nexmo, such as those on your Message Status webhook URL and Inbound Message URL, are queued by Nexmo on a per-message basis.

Please ensure that all applications acknowledge webhooks with a 200 response.

### Signed webhooks

In order to validate the origin of your webhooks, you can validate the signature of the webhooks, see instructions [here](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/concepts/signed-webhooks)

### Webhooks in production use

If the Webhook URLs for messages in your Nexmo Account are already in production use and you would like a second one for using the Messages API, please email [support@nexmo.com](mailto:support@nexmo.com) and ask for a sub API Key.
