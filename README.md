The `nexmo-developer` gem provides a documentation platform ready to use with your custom documentation. This document will cover installation and usage instructions.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [License](#license)

## Installation

You can use this gem from within your documentation. 

To install the gem, create a `Gemfile` in the root folder of your documentation files and add the following inside it:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/nexmo" do
  gem "nexmo-developer"
end
```

Then, run `bundle install` from the command line. If this is your first time installing a gem from the GitHub Package Registry, follow these [setup instructions](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-rubygems-for-use-with-github-packages).

## Usage 

This section will cover:

* [File Organization](#file-organization)
* [Configuration and Customization](#configuration-and-customization)
* [Running the Gem](#running-the-gem)

### File Organization

First, it is important that your documentation is organized in the way the gem expects.

The gem expects the documentation to be markdown files within the following folders:

```sh
+-- _open_api
+-- _use_cases
+-- _documentation
+-- _tutorials
```

In addition, the gem expects there to be **two top-level required folders** with configuration content, and a third top-level optional folder for public assets:

```sh
+-- config
+-- custom
+-- public
```

* The [Configuration Files](#configuration-files) section will document the files required inside the `/config` folder.
* The [Custom Views](#custom-views), [Custom Landing Pages](custom-landing-pages) and [Custom Locale Settings](#custom-locale-settings) sections will document the files required inside the `/custom` folder.
* The [Custom Public Assets](#custom-public-folder) section will document the files that can be included inside the `/public` folder.


### Configuration and Customization

* [Configuration Files](#configuration-files) for the documentation portal are inside the `/config` folder. 
* [Custom Views](#custom-views) can be provided inside the `/custom/views` folder.
* [Custom Landing Pages](#custom-landing-pages) can be provided inside the `/custom/landing_pages` folder.
* [Custom Public Assets](#custom-public-folder) can be provided inside the `/public` folder.
* [Custom Locale Settings](#custom-locale-settings) can be provided inside the `/custom/locales` folder

##### Configuration Files

**Sample configuration files can be found inside the [sample_config_files](sample_config_files/config) folder in this repository.**

1. Business Information, **including header and footer**:
  * Business information, including content for the header, can be customized through providing a `business_info.yml` configuration file inside the `/config` folder. The following is a sample `business_info.yml` configuration:

```yaml
name: VBC
subtitle: Business for Developers
base_url: https://developer.vonage.com
assets:
  header_logo:
    path: '/images/logos/vbc-logo.png'
    alt: 'VBC Logo'
  footer_logo:
    path: '/images/logos/footer-logo.png'
    alt: 'VBC Footer Logo'
header:
  links:
    sign-up:
      path: https://developer.vonage.com
      text:
        - 'Log In'
        - 'Try Me'
  hiring:
    display: true # or false
footer:
  links:
    status:
      path: https://developer.vonage.com
      text: 'VBC Status' 
    navigation:
      documentation:
        - call-recording: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/call-recording/overview'
        - provisioning: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/provisioning/overview'
        - telephony: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/telephony/overview'
        - reports: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/reports/overview'
        - vonage-integration-platform: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/vonage-integration-platform/overview'
        - smart-numbers: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/smart-numbers/overview'
      api-reference:
        - call-recording: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/api/call-recording'
        - provisioning: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/api/provisioning'
        - telephony: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/api/telephony'
        - reports: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/api/reports'
        - vonage-integration-platform: 'https://vbc-developer.herokuapp.com/api/vonage-integration-platform'
      get-to-know-us:
        - vonage-business-communications: 'https://www.vonage.com/unified-communications/'
        - careers: 'https://www.vonage.com/corporate/careers/'
        - press: 'https://www.vonage.com/corporate'
    support:
      business-support: 'https://businesssupport.vonage.com/'
      developer-support: 'devsupport@vonage.com'
  ```
2. Top navigation bar:
  * The links in the navigation bar can be customized through providing a `top_navigation.yml` configuration file inside the `/config` folder. In this file each navigation item should be provided on its own line in the following format: `Name: /url`. For example, `Documentation: /documentation`, is a valid entry. If a custom YAML file is not provided, the gem's default navigation bar will be rendered.

3. Header Meta Information:
  * Meta-tags for the site must be provided inside a `/config/meta_info.yml` file. If the entries are not provided in this file, the site will not execute:

```yaml
  title: # Title of your site for title bar
  description: # Description of site for search engines
  google-site-verification: # Verification code of site ownership for Google Search Console. *Will skip if not provided*
  application-name: # Name of application that the site represents
```

  * The site expects the following meta icons and files to be placed inside the `/public/meta` folder. If they are not there, the site will raise an exception and not run (for examples of all of these files you can visit https://developer.nexmo.com/#{name of the file} to see an example):

```bash
  og.png
  apple-touch-icon.png
  favicon.ico
  favicon-32x32.png
  manifest.json
  safari-pinned-tab.svg
  mstile-144x144.png
```

4. Products Listing

Products are listed inside `/config/products.yml`. Each product must be listed with:

* `icon`, which is the name of the Volta icon to use, for example `phone`.
* `icon_colour`, the colour of the icon.
* `path`, which is the folder name inside the documentation where the product is listed. For example, `call-recording` for Call Recording.
* `dropdown` of either `true` or `false`, specifying if the product should be listed in the product dropdown menu listings inside Use Cases and Tutorials.

An example `products.yml` file:

```yaml
products:
  - 
    name: 'Call Recording'
    icon: 'phone'
    icon_colour: 'blue'
    path: 'call-recording'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Node RED'
    icon: 'flow'
    icon_colour: 'red'
    path: 'node-red'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Provisioning'
    icon: 'phone'
    icon_colour: 'green'
    path: 'provisioning'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Reports'
    icon: 'file-search'
    icon_colour: 'purple-dark'
    path: 'reports'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Smart Numbers'
    icon: 'queue'
    icon_colour: 'yellow'
    path: 'smart-numbers'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Telephony'
    icon: 'phone'
    icon_colour: 'black'
    path: 'telephony'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Vonage Integration Platform'
    icon: 'chat'
    icon_colour: 'blue'
    path: 'vonage-integration-platform'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Zapier'
    icon: 'lock'
    icon_colour: 'blue'
    path: 'zapier'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'Concepts'
    icon: 'message'
    icon_colour: 'green'
    path: 'concepts'
    dropdown: true
  - 
    name: 'App Center'
    icon: 'file-search'
    icon_colour: 'purple'
    path: 'app-center'
    dropdown: true
```

#### Environment Variables

**An example [.env](.env.example) file can be found in this repository**

Within your runtime production environment you can specify the following environment variables related to Google Analytics:

```env
SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID
GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_ID
SEARCH_URL
```

You can also specify the following environment variable related to Hotjar analytics:

```env
HOTJAR_ID
```

The following can be specified for Bugsnag analytics:

```env
BUGSNAG_JS_API_KEY
```

For Algolia search specify the following environment variable:

```env
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID
```

##### Custom Views

**A sample [custom views folder](sample_config_files/custom/views) can be found in this repository**

All `nexmo-developer` static views can be redefined inside `/custom/views` by providing custom ERB files.

_ERB, or embedded Ruby, are HTML files that combine Ruby to produce dynamic content._

The following ERB files can be provided to override the default views:

* `/custom/views/static/landing.html.erb`: The default home page
* `/custom/views/layout/partials/_footer.html.erb`: The footer
* `/custom/views/layout/partials/_header.html.erb`: The header
* `/custom/views/layout/partials/_head.html.erb`: The head file (meta tags, Google analytics info, and more)

##### Custom Landing Pages

**A sample [custom landing pages folder](sample_config_files/custom/landing_pages) can be found in this repository**

Customized landing pages is a powerful feature of the `nexmo-developer` gem that provides the ability to create unique content using only YAML files. 

All custom landing page YAML files should be placed inside `/custom/landing_pages`. 

The URL path is defined by the file path. For example, a file placed inside `/custom/landing_pages/tools.yml` would be viewed at `https://[YOUR WEBSITE URL]/tools`. 

Instructions for creating custom landing pages can be found [here](https://developer.nexmo.com/contribute/guides/landing-pages).

##### Custom Public Path

Custom assets, such as images and icons, can be provided in the `/public` folder. They then can be referenced inside [custom views](#custom-views). For example, if the following image is added inside `/public/assets/media/logos/sample_image.png` then it could be referenced using ERB syntax as follows:

```ruby
<%= image_tag('/assets/media/logos/sample_image.png') %>
```

#### Custom Locale Settings

**A sample [custom locales folder](sample_config_files/config/locales) can be found in this repository**

Customized text to display for the menu and different display layouts can be provided inside the custom locale files. They are placed inside the `/custom/locales` folder in the documentation path. Each file is a YAML file named with the 2-letter abbreviation for the language, for example, English locale settings are placed inside `/custom/locales/en.yml`. The following is an example `en.yml` file showing custom text for the menu and for the site header:

```yaml
en:
  menu:
    call-recording: Call Recording
    provisioning: Provisioning
    reports: Reports
    telephony: Telephony
    vonage-integration-platform: Vonage Integration Platform
    node-red: Node-RED
    zapier: Zapier
    extension: Extension
    user: User
    call: Call
    concepts: Concepts
    getting-started: Getting Started
    call_leg: Call Leg
    device_registration: Device Registration
    export-job: Export Job
    download: Download
    company-call-recording: Company Call Recording
    on-demand-call-recording: On-Demand Call Recording
    webhook: Webhook
    app-center: App Center
  layouts:
    partials:
      header:
        team: Team
        use-cases: Use Cases
        hiring: We're hiring
```

### Running The Gem

Once you have installed the gem and ran through the configurations, you can start it. 

To start the gem run the following from the command line:

```sh
$ OAS_PATH=[PATH TO _open_api folder] RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true DISABLE_SSL=1 RACK_ENV=production RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec nexmo-developer --docs=[PATH TO DOCUMENTATION]
```

For example, if your documentation is at `/Users/sample_user/Documents/sample_docs` and your `_open_api` folder is at `/Users/sample_user/Documents/sample_docs/_open_api` then you would start `nexmo-developer` with the following command:

```sh
$ OAS_PATH=/Users/sample_user/Documents/sample_docs/_open_api RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true DISABLE_SSL=1 RACK_ENV=production RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec nexmo-developer --docs=/Users/sample_user/Documents/sample_docs
```
