    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to make a
    phone call from your web app to a <abbr title="Public Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</abbr> phone.

    To achieve this, you will need:

    * A web application that will make the voice call using the Client SDK
    * An <abbr title="Nexmo Call Control Object">NCCO</abbr> to forward the inbound voice call to the destination phone

    When the call is triggered from your application, Nexmo will get the NCCO from Glitch and forward the call to the destination phone number.
