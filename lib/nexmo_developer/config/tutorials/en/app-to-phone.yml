    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to make a
    phone call from your web app to a phone.

    To achieve this, you will need:

    * A web application that will make the voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions on how to handle the call. You will use a GitHub Gist to accomplish this. <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Gists</a> are a simple way to share code snippets with others.
