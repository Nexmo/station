    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to make a 
    phone call from your web app to another web app.

    To achieve this, you will create:

    * A web application that will make the app to app voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A webhook server that can process an inbound webhook and return an <abbr title="Nexmo Call Control Object">NCCO</abbr> to forward the inbound voice call to the destination app.

    When the in-app call is triggered from your application, Nexmo will make a request to your webhook server. You then use an NCCO and forward the call to the destination app.
