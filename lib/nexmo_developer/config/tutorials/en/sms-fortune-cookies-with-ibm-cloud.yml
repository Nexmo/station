external_link: https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/08/14/serverless-sms-nexmo-ibm-dr/
description: Receive SMS from a user, and respond using a serverless function. This example uses IBM Cloud Functions to receive the webhook notification of the incoming SMS request, and respond by sending an SMS (containing a fortune cookie as a very simple example) back to the user. An ideal model for low-traffic use cases where users need up-to-date information by SMS.
