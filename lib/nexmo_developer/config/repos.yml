# Nexmo repos
# ===========
#
# Used by code examples.
#
# Basic Usage
# -----------
#
# $ bundle exec rake repos:pull

# they can be reviewed alongside pull-requests
#
# Developing Locally
# ------------------
#
# Uncomment the path and point it to your local
# working copy of the repo. Running the script
# create a symlink to that directory in place.
#
# Once you are happy with the changes push your
# working repo branch up and comment out the path
# referencing it on GitHub and rerun the command.
