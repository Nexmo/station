                When making a voice call with Tropo you provide the words to be spoken directly in your application. On the Nexmo platform, calls are controlled using an [NCCO](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference), which is a JSON file that tells the Nexmo voice API how to interact with the call.
                
                In the example below, we use a static JSON file that returns a single `talk` action containing text which will be spoken in to the call.
  
                ```json
                [
                  {
                    "action": "talk",
                    "voiceName": "Russell",
                    "text": "You are listening to a test text-to-speech call made with Nexmo Voice API"
                  }
                ]
                ```
                
                Text-to-speech is just one of the many actions you can perform with the Nexmo voice API. You can [record calls](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#record), [stream audio](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#stream), [build interactive menus](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#input) and more! Take a look at our [NCCO documentation](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) for more information.
