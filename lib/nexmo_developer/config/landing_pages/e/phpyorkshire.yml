            - content: |
                You'll be glad to hear that there are multiple ways to get an ElePHPant! 
                
                * Fill in [our survey](https://nexmodevrel.typeform.com/to/RVnhoy), and we'll enter you into a raffle to win one before the end of the conference.
                * Want another entry to the raffle? Use our coupon for free credit on your Nexmo account (yes, that's right, we're giving you money *and* another chance at winning an elePHPant)

                Do you <strong>really</strong> want an elePHPant, and you're looking for something less luck-based and more guaranteed?

                * Build something with one of the [Nexmo APIs](/api) and come and demo it to us on the booth in exchange for a Sonny. (We're afraid it'll have to be more than just sending a text message - show us your creativity!) Usage of the [Messages](/messages/overview) or [Voice](/voice/voice-api/overview) APIs is recommended.
                * Apply to write something for our [Developer Spotlight](/spotlight) program and when your post is published not only will you get paid $400 (~¬£300), but we'll ship you an ElePHPant too!
