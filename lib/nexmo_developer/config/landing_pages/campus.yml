            <h4>Getting started with Messages & Dispatch</h4>
            <p>In this workshop, we’re going to learn how to communicate with customers over their preferred channels using Nexmo’s Messages and Dispatch APIs.</p>
            <p>We will start with an overview of Nexmo messaging concepts and learn how to use the SMS, MMS, Facebook Messenger, Viber and WhatsApp integrations, going into specifics for each platform and what purposes they are most suited for.</p>
            <p>During the second part, we’re going to use the Dispatch API to create a multi channel strategy that incorporates failover to secondary channels.</p>

            <h4>Getting started with Voice API</h4>
            <p>When we speak to our customers, it's important to give a genuine and personal touch - but having some automation in your telephone communications can help both you and your customers to have better conversations. This hands-on workshop will introduce you to the Voice API, teaching you to build an application to answer a voice call, interact with your user, and direct them to the right human for that meaningful conversation. We'll talk about accepting input from users, recording calls to protect both you and them, and give advice on building applications for voice interaction.</p>

            <h4>Building a voice-enabled website using the Nexmo Client SDK</h4>
            <p>In this workshop, we’ll walk through how you can make a phone call from a web browser to a phone with Nexmo In-App Voice using the Nexmo Client SDK for JavaScript. The Nexmo Client SDK is in the Early Access stage, so we’d love your feedback on both the development experience that you have and on the functionality that’s provided.</p>
            <p>We'll go through everything you need to start building voice-enabled websites using Node, the Nexmo Server SDK for JavaScript and the Nexmo Client SDK.</p>

            <h4>Building communications workflows with NodeRED</h4>
            <p>NodeRED is a visual flow based programming environment that allows anyone to create a workflow with just a web browser. There is no "code" to write you simply drag in and wire up a set of pre built blocks to create your workflow.</p>
            <p>We will show you how to create a basic IVR, forward calls, and capture recordings from callers as well as trigger outbound calls and notification messages.</p>
            <p>Part of the power of NodeRED is it’s open source ecosystem so we will show you how to combine Vonage APIS with nodes from other 3rd party services to create your own custom integrations.</p>
            <p>No previous knowledge of programming is needed although a basic understanding of the Nexmo product would help. The only tool needed is a web browser ideally on Mac, Windows, Linux or Chromebooks, iPads can be supported but the experience is sub optimal.</p>

            <h4>Using Nexmo Voice WebSockets with IBM Watson</h4>
            <p>Discover how you can use Artificial Intelligence to perform sentiment analysis of an audio stream, in real-time! In this workshop, we’re going to learn how to create a virtual rapporteur. A digital assistant who can join any conference call; record it, and then by using IBM Watson provide participants with a real-time transcript and insights into the overall tone of the call. All pushed to their browser via WebSockets.</p>

            <h4>Adding programmable voice & video to a web app using the OpenTok API</h4>
            <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how to add programmable voice and video to a web application using the OpenTok API. Using the OpenTok API, you will also be able to add screen sharing archiving (recording), and connecting to PSTN participants by integrating with Nexmo SIP Connect. Additionally, Manik will cover best practices on debugging the programmable voice & video using tools such as Playground and Session Inspector.</p>

            <h4>Introducing Nexmo Conversations</h4>
            <p>Communication nowadays has many faces, many forms, and many channels. Your customers are everywhere, using SMS, phone calls, apps and social media - and you want to walk with them wherever they go, whilst maintaining a seamless meaningful relationship. Sounds like a challenge?</p>
            <p>This session introduces Nexmo Conversations - an omnichannel API and suite of SDKs that gather all your customers' communication events into one coherent journey.</p>
            <p>With a few lines of code, you can enable your mobile and web applications with additional channels and functionality that allow you to engage in meaningful conversations with your users.

            <h4>Building a Recording Service for Real-Time Video Communications at Global Scale</h4>
            <p>Recording for Video Real-Time Communications is one of the cutting edge features that is provided to developers by the Vonage RTC video API. As simple as the API for recording may be, there are a lot of challenges beneath the scenes that we at Vonage Video Engineering face and solve in order to provide the service at Global Scale and at the Best Quality in Real-Time.</p>
            <p>This talk will provide a glimpse inside the magical backend and the challenges of building and scaling a Multi-Datacenter, Real-Time Video Recording Service. Topics will vary from machine level optimizations to multi-datacenter recorder selection. On the machine level optimization topic we will cover video stream synchronization, real-time video transcoding and video processing challenges. Moving a level up in abstraction we will discuss multi-datacenter server selection for real-time recorder allocation based on Statistical Predictive Models.</p>

            <h4>Open API Descriptions to Power Up Your API Workflow</h4>
            <p>Have you noticed how many of your favourite API providers are offering their specs in OpenAPI format now? This session will introduce you to OpenAPI and why API providers are increasingly offering it to their users to enable adoption and make integrations easier. Learn about the format, the tools, and how an OpenAPI description can help you to get on board with a new API - or of course help your customers adopt your own APIs. We'll be sharing why we chose OpenAPI, our workflows, and the tools we use.</p>

            <h4>Enabling modern workflow automation with GitHub Actions</h4>
            <p>Your development process is almost perfect. 90% perfect, even. Github provides most of what you need, and third party integrations cover the rest, but what about that last 10%? What about the things that are unique to you, your team, and your business?</p>
            <p>Github Actions let you bridge that gap, running code that's specific to you as part of your development and deployment workflow. Come and learn what Github Actions can do for you, and how Nexmo uses them to streamline their development processes.</p>
