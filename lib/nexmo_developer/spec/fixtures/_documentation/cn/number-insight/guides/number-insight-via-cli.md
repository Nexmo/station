Using Number Insight via the Nexmo CLI
======================================

概述
---

You can use the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) to work with the Number Insight API without having to create the requests using `curl` or by writing program code. This guide shows you how.

入门
---

### Before you begin:

* Sign up for a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/signup) - this will give you the API key and secret that you will need to access the Number Insight API.
* Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - you will use `npm` (the Node Package Manager) to install the Nexmo CLI.

### Install and Setup the Nexmo CLI (Command Line Interface)

Execute the following command at a terminal prompt to install the Nexmo CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g nexmo-cli
```

> *Note* : If you do not have sufficient system privileges you might need to prefix the above command with `sudo`.

Then, provide the Nexmo CLI with your `VONAGE_API_KEY` and `VONAGE_API_SECRET` which you can
find on the [dashboard getting started page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide):

```bash
$ nexmo setup VONAGE_API_KEY VONAGE_API_SECRET
```

You only need to do this the first time you use the Nexmo CLI.

Try your own number with the Basic API
--------------------------------------

The Number Insight Basic API is free to use. Test it with your own number by using `nexmo insight:basic` (or `nexmo ib`) and replacing the number shown with your own number. The number must be in [international format](/voice/voice-api/guides/numbers#formatting):

```bash
$ nexmo insight:basic 447700900000
```

The Nexmo CLI displays the number you entered and the country it belongs to:

```bash
447700900000 | GB
```

To see the other details that the response from the Number Insight API contains, use the `--verbose` switch (or `-v` for short):

```bash
$ nexmo insight:basic --verbose 447700900000
```

The full response from the Basic API contains the following information:
````
[status]
0

[status_message]
Success

[request_id]
385bf642-d096-4b85-9dfc-4c1910d65300

[international_format_number]
447700900000

[national_format_number]
07700 900000

[country_code]
GB

[country_code_iso3]
GBR

[country_name]
United Kingdom

[country_prefix]
44
````
This human-readable output mirrors the field names and data available in the JSON response: it returns data about your request (`status`, `status_message`, `request_id`), details of the country that the number belongs to (`country_name`, `country_prefix` etc.) and how to format the number appropriately for that country (`national_format_number`).

> If you do not see a response similar to that shown above, check your API credentials and ensure that you have installed Node.js and `nexmo-cli` properly.

Test the Standard and Advanced APIs
-----------------------------------

The Standard and Advanced Number Insight APIs provide even more information about the number including details of the operator and roaming status (for mobile numbers). See the [feature comparison table](/number-insight/overview#basic-standard-and-advanced-apis) to see the response data that each API level includes.

> **Note** : Calls to the Standard and Advanced APIs are not free, and you will be asked to confirm that you wish to charge your account when you use them.

### Using the Number Insight Standard API

To use the Number Insight Standard API, use the `nexmo insight:standard` command

```bash
$ nexmo insight:standard --verbose 447700900000
```

A typical response from the Standard API looks like this:
````
[status]
0

[status_message]
Success

[request_id]
aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab

[international_format_number]
447700900000

[national_format_number]
07700 900000

[country_code]
GB

[country_code_iso3]
GBR

[country_name]
United Kingdom

[country_prefix]
44

[request_price]
0.00500000

[remaining_balance]
1.995

[current_carrier.network_code]

[current_carrier.name]
Hutchison 3G Ltd

[current_carrier.country]

[current_carrier.network_type]

[original_carrier.name]

### Using the Number Insight Advanced API

To use the Advanced API, use `insight:advanced` (or `ia`):

```bash
$ nexmo insight:advanced --verbose 447700900000
```

Look for the following additional fields in the response:
````
[lookup_outcome]
0

[lookup_outcome_message]
Success

[valid_number]
valid

[reachable]
reachable

[roaming.status]
not_roaming
````
The `[lookup_outcome]` and `[lookup_outcome_message]` fields tell you whether the Advanced API was able to determine the validity (`[valid_number]`), reachability (`[reachable]`) and roaming status (`[roaming.status]`) of the number.
