Number Management
=================

The easiest way to rent, configure and manage your numbers is to use the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

You can use the dashboard to:

* [Rent virtual numbers](#rent-a-virtual-number)
* [Configure virtual numbers](#configure-a-virtual-number)

Rent a virtual number
---------------------

To rent a Nexmo virtual number:

1. Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click **Numbers** then **Buy numbers** .
3. Choose the attributes you need and then click **Search** .
4. Click the **Buy** button next to the number you want and validate your purchase.
5. Your virtual number is now listed in **Your numbers** .
6. If your account has no credit your virtual numbers are released for resale. To avoid this, enable [auto-reload payments](/numbers/guides/payments#auto-reload-your-account-balance).

> You rent each virtual number by the month. The renewal date is relative to the original subscription date. The rental price is automatically deducted from your Nexmo account on the same day every month. However, if you rented a virtual number on the last day of the month, the renewal date is last day of the next month. For example, if you rented a number on the 28th of February, subsequent renewal dates would be the 31st March, the 30th April, and so on.

Configure a virtual number
--------------------------

To configure a Nexmo virtual number:

1. Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click **Numbers** then **Your numbers** .
3. Click the gear icon next to the number you want to configure.
4. Edit your configuration as required and then click **OK** . (If you are changing a [webhook endpoint](/concepts/guides/webhooks), ensure that the new webhook endpoint is live first.)
