Enable Two-Factor Authentication
==================================

[Two-factor authentication](/concepts/guides/glossary#2fa) (2FA) gives you confidence that the number your customer provides you with belongs to them. If you are sending SMS to customers in the US, you can use a [short code](/concepts/guides/glossary#short-code) for this. A customer verifies their number by responding directly to the short code or via your web application. Nexmo's [Two-Factor Authentication API](/api/sms/us-short-codes/2fa) provides this capability.

> These instructions assume that you are using a shared short code. Nexmo also offers dedicated short codes specific to your organization. Find out more about short codes [here](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013144287-Short-codes-Features-Overview).

To configure a shared US short code for 2FA:

1. Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click **Numbers** then **Buy numbers** .
3. Click the **add a shared short code** link.
4. Click the **Add a short code for two factor authentication** button.
5. Configure your message and company name.
6. Click **Update** . Nexmo will process your application. Approval can take up to five business days.
