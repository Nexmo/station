# Number Insight Advanced API

The Number Insight API gives you real-time information about phone numbers worldwide. There are three levels available: Basic, Standard and Advanced.

The Advanced level provides you with the most comprehensive data to help protect your organization from fraud and spam. Unlike the Basic and Standard levels, you typically access the Advanced API asynchronously, via a [webhook](/concepts/guides/webhooks).
