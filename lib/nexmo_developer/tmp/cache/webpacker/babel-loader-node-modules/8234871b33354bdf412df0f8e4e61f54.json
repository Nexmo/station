Think of several addPause()'s in a timeline that forces the playhead to a certain spot, but what if it's already paused and another tween is tweening the \"time\" of the timeline? Each time it moves [forward] past that spot, it would move back, and since suppressEvents is true, it'd reset _rawPrevTime to _tinyNum so that when it begins again, the callback would fire (so ultimately it could bounce back and forth during that tween). Again, this is a very uncommon scenario, but possible nonetheless.\n        this._rawPrevTime = 0;\n      }\n    }\n  }; //---- STATIC FUNCTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  TweenMax.to = function (target, duration, vars) {\n    return new TweenMax(target, duration, vars);\n  };\n\n  TweenMax.from = function (target, duration, vars) {\n    vars.runBackwards = true;\n    vars.immediateRender = vars.immediateRender != false;\n    return new TweenMax(target, duration, vars);\n  };\n\n  TweenMax.fromTo = function (target, duration, fromVars, toVars) {\n    toVars.startAt = fromVars;\n    toVars.immediateRender = toVars.immediateRender != false && fromVars.immediateRender != false;\n    return new TweenMax(target, duration, toVars);\n  };\n\n  TweenMax.staggerTo = TweenMax.allTo = function (targets, duration, vars, stagger, onCompleteAll, onCompleteAllParams, onCompleteAllScope) {\n    stagger = stagger || 0;\n\n    var delay = 0,\n        a = [],\n        finalComplete = function finalComplete() {\n      if (vars.onComplete) {\n        vars.onComplete.apply(vars.onCompleteScope || this, arguments);\n      }\n\n      onCompleteAll.apply(onCompleteAllScope || vars.callbackScope || this, onCompleteAllParams || _blankArray);\n    },\n        cycle = vars.cycle,\n        fromCycle = vars.startAt && vars.startAt.cycle,\n        l,\n        copy,\n        i,\n        p;\n\n    if (!_isArray(targets)) {\n      if (typeof targets === \"string\") {\n        targets = TweenLite.selector(targets) || targets;\n      }\n\n      if (_isSelector(targets)) {\n        targets = _slice(targets);\n      }\n    }\n\n    targets = targets || [];\n\n    if (stagger < 0) {\n      targets = _slice(targets);\n      targets.reverse();\n      stagger *= -1;\n    }\n\n    l = targets.length - 1;\n\n    for (i = 0;
