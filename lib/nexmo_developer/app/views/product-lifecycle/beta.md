# Beta

Beta products at Nexmo are in the final stages of testing before they become generally available. Beta products are typically production ready, and the Beta phase is used to ensure that the product is stable, secure and scaleable.

Breaking changes at this stage in the lifecycle are **extremely** rare and only happen in cases where the feature impacts platform stability.

## Support

If you encounter an issue with a Beta product you can email [support@nexmo.com](mailto:support@nexmo.com) as usual. Normal support SLAs do not apply.

At this stage we may not be aware of all possible issues and some investigation may be needed in conjunction with the engineering team.

## Documentation

We aim to have conceptual documentation, tutorials and code samples available for all Beta products.

## Client Libaries

Client libraries are available in Java, JavaScript, .NET, PHP, Python and Ruby<sup>*</sup>

<small>* *Excluded products*: Conversation API</small>


## Deprecation

We will provide a minimum of 30 days notice of any deprecated features during the Beta period. Deprecated products may continue to function after the deprecation date, but we make no promises that they will work indefinitely.
