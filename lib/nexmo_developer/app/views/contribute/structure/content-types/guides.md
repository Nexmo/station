# Guides

The Guides provide information on the key concepts associated with a product.

Ideally the Guide should also point to further useful resources such as:

* Code Snippets - Guides may link to Code Snippets to show specific implementation details.
* Use Cases - Step-by-step instructions to solve specific use cases with the Nexmo APIs.
* API Reference - Full details of the API's functionality.
