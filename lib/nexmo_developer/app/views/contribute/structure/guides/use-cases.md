# Use Cases

Use Cases provide guidance on how to implement real-world scenarios using Vonage APIs and third-party APIs and products.

Whereas Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on how to do specific things with one product, Use Cases describe far more complex scenarios, that may use seevral Vonage API products, and optionally external provider products.

Use Cases do not have to provide a step-by-step approach, although sometimes they do.

## Examples

* [Order Support System](https://developer.nexmo.com/use-cases/client-sdk-sendinblue-order-confirm) - A Use Case demonstrating Conversation API, Client SDK and SendInBlue API for email. This describes implementing an Order Spport System scenario.
