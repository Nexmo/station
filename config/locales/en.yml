# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      A Nexmo application contains the required configuration for your project. You can create an application using the <a href="https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli">Nexmo CLI</a> (see below) or <a href="https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/create-application">via the dashboard</a>. To learn more about applications <a href="/concepts/guides/applications">see our Nexmo concepts guide</a>.
    once_you_have_the_cli_installed_html: >-
      Once you have the CLI installed you can use it to create a Nexmo application. Run the following command and make a note of the application ID that it returns. This is the value to use in <code>NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID</code> in the example below. It will also create <code>private.key</code> in the current directory which you will need in the <em>Initialize your dependencies</em> step
    nexmo_needs_to_connect_html: >-
      Nexmo needs to connect to your local machine to access your <code>answer_url</code>. We recommend using <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/">ngrok</a> to do this. Make sure to change <code>demo.ngrok.io</code> in the examples below to your own ngrok URL.

            We can use the `application` plugin for Gradle to simplify the running of our application.
             Update your `build.gradle` with the following:

             ```groovy
            apply plugin: 'application'
            mainClassName = project.hasProperty('main') ? project.getProperty('main') : ''
            ```

            Run the following `gradle` command to execute your application, replacing `%{chomped_package}` with the package containing `%{file}`:

            <pre class="highlight bash run-command"><code>gradle run -Pmain=%{main}</code></pre>
