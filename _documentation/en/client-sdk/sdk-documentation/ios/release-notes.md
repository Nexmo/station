- Start server call stability
- Receiving a DTMF event in call and conversation

```
- (void)conversation:(nonnull NXMConversation *)conversation didReceiveDTMFEvent:(nullable NXMDTMFEvent *)event;
```

### Changed

`NXMClient` - client enable push notifications method changed.
`param pushKitToken` - only for VoIP push (incoming calls).
`param userNotificationToken` - all push types:

```
- (void)enablePushNotificationsWithPushKitToken:(nullable NSData *)pushKitToken
                          userNotificationToken:(nullable NSData *)userNotificationToken
                                      isSandbox:(BOOL)isSandbox
                              completionHandler:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error))completionHandler;
```

## Version 1.0.0 - 2019-09-05

### Fixed

- `NexmoClient` when disconnected returns error callback for all function.
- `CallMember` status calculated by the current leg status.
- `CallMember` supports failed, busy, timeout and canceled statuses.
- Supports member invited.
- `Conversation` has media methods.
- `NexmoClient` is now singleton.
- Call method changed to string instead of array.
- `NexmoClient` delegate methods renamed.

### Added

- Added conversation media:

```objective-c
NXMConversation myConversation;
[myConversation enableMedia];   // my media will be enabled
[myConversation disableMedia];  // my media will be disabled
```
​
Added invite member:

```objective-c
NXMConversation myConversation;
[myConversation inviteMemberWithUsername:@"someUsername"
                      completion:myCompletionBlock];
```
​
- Added the member state initiator:

```objective-c
NXMMember *member = someMember;
NSDictionary<NSValue *, NXMInitiator *> *initiators = member.initiators; 
​
NXMInitiator leftStateInitiator = initiators[NXMMemberStateLeft];
leftStateInitiator.isSystem;
leftStateInitiator.userId;
leftStateInitiator.memberId;
leftStateInitiator.time;
```

Added `NXMConversationUpdateDelegate` to notify on member updates like media,leg, and state.
Added `updatesDelegate` property to `NXMConversation`:

```objective-c
@property (nonatomic, weak, nullable) id <NXMConversationUpdateDelegate> updatesDelegate;
```

Example:

```objective-c
@interface MyClass() <NXMConversationUpdateDelegate>
@implementation MyClass
​
- (void)setConversation:(NXMConversation *conversation) {
	conversation.updatesDelegate(self); // register to conversation updatesDelegate
}
​
- (void)conversation:(nonnull NXMConversation *)conversation didUpdateMember:(nonnull NXMMember *)member withType:(NXMMemberUpdateType)type {
	if (type == NXMMemberUpdateTypeState) {
		// the member state changed
	}
​
	if (type == NXMMemberUpdateTypeMedia) {
		// the member media changed
	}
}
@end
```
​
### Changed
​
- `NXMClient` is now a singleton:

```objective-c
NXMClient.shared // the shared instance of NXMClient
```

Renamed:

```objective-c
@property (nonatomic, readonly, nullable, getter=getToken) NSString *authToken; // was token
​
// was - (void)login;
- (void)loginWithAuthToken:(NSString *)authToken;
​
// was - (void)refreshAuthToken:(nonnull NSString *)authToken;
- (void)updateAuthToken:(nonnull NSString *)authToken;
​
// was callees array
- (void)call:(nonnull NSString *)callee
    callHandler:(NXMCallHandler)callHandler
    delegate:(nullable id<NXMCallDelegate>)delegate
  completion:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error, NXMCall * _Nullable call))completion;
completionHandler:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error, NXMCall * _Nullable call))completionHandler;
```
​
- `NXMClientDelegate` renamed:

```objective-c
@protocol NXMClientDelegate <NSObject>
​
// was - (void)connectionStatusChanged:(NXMConnectionStatus)status reason:(NXMConnectionStatusReason)reason;
- (void)client:(nonnull NXMClient *)client didChangeConnectionStatus:(NXMConnectionStatus)status reason:(NXMConnectionStatusReason)reason;
​
// was - (void)incomingCall:(nonnull NXMCall *)call;

NSArray<NXMMember *> * allMembers = myConversation.allMembers // return the all conversation members
​
- (void)joinMemberWithUsername:(nonnull NSString *)username // username instead of userId
```
​
- `NXMConversationDelegate` renamed methods:

```objective-c
