# Get a specific record by UUID

This code snippet shows you how to retrieve a specific record by specifying a **message or call** UUID. This is a synchronous call and so will block until it returns a response.

## Example

Variable | Required | Description
----|----|----
`NEXMO_API_KEY` | Yes | Your API key which you can obtain from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-in).
`NEXMO_API_SECRET` | Yes | Your API secret which you can obtain from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-in).
`ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | The API key for the target account. Reports generated, or records retrieved, are for this account.
`REPORT_DIRECTION` | Yes | Either `inbound` or `outbound`
`REPORT_PRODUCT` | Yes | Specifies the product for which reports and records are obtained. Can be one of `SMS`, `VOICE-CALL`, `VERIFY-API`, `NUMBER-INSIGHT`, `MESSAGES` or `CONVERSATIONS`.
`ID` | Yes | The UUID of the message or call to retrieve records for.

## Try it out

1. Set the replaceable variables for your account.  

2. For this example, set `REPORT_PRODUCT` to `SMS`.

3. Using the table as a guide set values for the remaining variables.

4. Run the script and you receive a response similar to the following:

```json
