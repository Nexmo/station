# Send a File Message

In this code snippet you learn how to send a WhatsApp file message using the Messages API. For WhatsApp the maximum outbound media size is 64MB.

> **IMPORTANT:** If a customer has not messaged you first, then the first time you send a message to a user, WhatsApp requires that the message contains a template. This is explained in more detail in the [Understanding WhatsApp topic](/messages/concepts/whatsapp).

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`BASE_URL` | For production use the base URL is `https://api.nexmo.com/`. For sandbox testing the base URL is `https://messages-sandbox.nexmo.com/`.
`MESSAGES_API_URL` | For production use the Messages API endpoint is `https://api.nexmo.com/v0.1/messages`. For sandbox testing the Messages API endpoint is `https://messages-sandbox.nexmo.com/v0.1/messages`.
`WHATSAPP_NUMBER` | The WhatsApp number that has been allocated to you by Nexmo. For sandbox testing the number is `14157386170`.
`TO_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message to.
`FILE_URL` | The URL of the file to send.
`FILE_CAPTION` | The text describing the file being sent.

> **NOTE:** Don't use a leading `+` or `00` when entering a phone number, start with the country code, for example, 447700900000.
