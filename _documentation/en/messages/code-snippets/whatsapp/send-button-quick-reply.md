# Send a Quick Reply Button

In this code snippet you learn how to send a quick reply style button on WhatsApp. This uses Nexmo's [custom object](/messages/concepts/custom-objects) facility. You can reference the WhatsApp developer docs for the specifics of the [message format](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/message-templates/interactive-message-templates).

When the message recipient clicks on the quick reply button, Nexmo will `POST` relevant data to your inbound message webhook URL.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`BASE_URL` | For production use the base URL is `https://api.nexmo.com/`. For sandbox testing the base URL is `https://messages-sandbox.nexmo.com/`.
`MESSAGES_API_URL` | For production use the Messages API endpoint is `https://api.nexmo.com/v0.1/messages`. For sandbox testing the Messages API endpoint is `https://messages-sandbox.nexmo.com/v0.1/messages`.
`WHATSAPP_NUMBER` | The WhatsApp number that has been allocated to you by Nexmo. For sandbox testing the number is `14157386170`.
`TO_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message to.
`WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE` | The namespace ID found in your WhatsApp Business Account. Only templates created in your own namespace will work. Using an template with a namespace outside of your own results in an error code 1022 being returned. For sandbox testing the supported namespace is `9b6b4fcb_da19_4a26_8fe8_78074a91b584`.
`WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_NAME` | The name of the template created in your WhatsApp Business Account. For sandbox testing the `verify` template is currently available. Refer to [this table](/messages/concepts/messages-api-sandbox#whatsapp-templates-for-use-with-the-messages-api-sandbox) for new templates as they become available.

> **NOTE:** Don't use a leading `+` or `00` when entering a phone number, start with the country code, for example, 447700900000.

## Try it out

When you run the code a WhatsApp reminder message is sent to the destination number. The message has two quick reply buttons which you can use to select whether you are going to the event or not. When a button is pressed data similar to the following is posted to your inbound webhook URL:

``` json
{
    "message_uuid": "28ee5a1c-c4cc-48ec-922c-01520d4d396b",
    "to": {
        "number": "447700000000",
        "type": "whatsapp"
    },
    "from": {
        "number": "447700000001",
        "type": "whatsapp"
    },
    "timestamp": "2019-12-03T12:45:57.929Z",
    "direction": "inbound",
    "message": {
        "content": {
            "type": "button",
            "button": {
                "payload": "Yes-Button-Payload",
                "text": "Yes"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the recipient clicked the yes button.
