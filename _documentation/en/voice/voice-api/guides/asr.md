# Speech Recognition (ASR) [Beta]

## Overview

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) enables apps to support voice input for such use cases as IVR, identification and different kinds of voice bots/assistants. Using this feature, the app gets transcribed user speech (in the text form) once it expects the user to answer some question just by saying it rather than entering digits (DTMF); and then may continue the call flow according to its business logic based on what the user said.

## How it works

![ASR Flow](https://app.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/7840753c-7db0-4ec4-bab1-1e453d950762/image.png)

Typically, ASR is used in conjunction with an audio message playing to the user. The message might be an [audio file](/voice/voice-api/code-snippets/play-an-audio-stream-into-a-call) or [Text-to-Speech](/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech), or a combination of both played sequentially. To activate the ASR, NCCO should contain an `input` action with speech parameters specified.

### NCCO Example

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Please tell us, how can we help you today?",
    "bargeIn": true
  },
  {
    "eventUrl": [
      "https://api.example.com/callbacks/events"
    ],
    "eventMethod": "POST",
    "action": "input",
    "speech": {
      "uuid": [
        "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab"
      ],
      "language": "en-gb",
      "context": [
        "support",
        "buy",
        "credit",
        "account"
      ]      
    }
  }
]
```

The [NCCO Reference Guide](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#speech-recognition-settings) contains information on all the possible parameters that can be used in conjunction with the ASR `input` NCCO action.

### Call ID

ASR action (`input` with `speech`) cannot be executed for the whole conversation; it’s performed against the call (leg), so the call identifier should be explicitly specified in the NCCO as the `speech.uuid` parameter.

### Language

The expected language of user speech should be specified as the `language` parameter (`en-US` by default).

### Context

Some hints might be provided using the `context` array parameter to improve recognition quality. The values set might be the words or phrases expected from the user, for example, `['one', 'two', 'three']` or `['support', 'order starship']`.

### Barge In

If the user is calling not for the first time, they may already know the question to be asked, so the user may start speaking even before the audio message finishes. In order to support that, `bargeIn` parameter of the TTS (or `stream` - whatever action is used for the message) should be activated.

### Event Payload Example

Once the NCCO `input` action is completed, the input callback will be sent:

```json
{
  "speech": {
    "timeout_reason": "end_on_silence_timeout",
    "results": [
      {
        "confidence": "0.9405097",
        "text": "Support"
      },
      {
        "confidence": "0.70543784",
        "text": "Supper"
      },
      {
        "confidence": "0.5949854",
        "text": "Puppy"
      }
    ]
  },
  "dtmf": {
    "digits": null,
    "timed_out": false
  },
  "uuid": "529aa8f0-0ad8-42b0-ad61-b76dca18bb52",
  "conversation_uuid": "CON-7347b08d-5f51-478f-bfb2-e8c3fd39509f",
  "timestamp": "2020-02-07T11:42:40.933Z"
}
```

In the response body, a new NCCO is expected, containing next call flow actions based on application logic and user input (`speech.results.text`).
