# Send payment authentication code

Verify API supports Strong Customer Authentication for payments. To begin the process, supply the customer's telephone number (in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) ), the payee that will receive the payment, and the amount (in Euro) of the transaction, to the [PSD2 endpoint](/api/verify#verifyRequestWithPSD2).

The Verify API returns a `request_id`. Use this to identify a specific verification request in subsequent calls to the API, such as when making a [check request](/verify/code-snippets/check-verify-request) to see if the user provided the correct code.

Replace the following variables in the sample code with your own values:

Name | Description
--|--
`NEXMO_API_KEY` | Your Nexmo [API key](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/authentication#api-key-and-secret)
`NEXMO_API_SECRET` | Your Nexmo [API secret](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/authentication#api-key-and-secret)
`RECIPIENT_NUMBER` | The phone number to verify
`PAYEE` | Included in the message to describe the payment recipient
`AMOUNT` | How much the payment is for (always in Euro)
