## About the Conversation API

The Nexmo Conversation API enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple mediums including IP Messaging, PSTN Voice, SMS and WebRTC Audio and Video. The context of the conversations is maintained though each communication event taking place within a conversation, no matter the medium.

Currently the Conversation API offers basic IP messaging with the following features:

* Conversation creation and management
* Sending and receiving text
* Member invite management
* Cache support
* Typing indicators
* Message sent, delivered and read receipts

Upcoming features will include:

* Image support
* Push notifications
* Voice support

## Participating in the Early Adopter program

The Early Adopter (EA) program will take place for the next couple of months with a focus on the IP messaging capabilities. During this extended Beta program there will be frequent releases with new features and bug fixes based on your feedback. Changes will be communicated with each release outlying what changed. During the Beta it is possible (and probable) that there shall be breaking changes to the SDK and API but these will be explicitly communicated beforehand.
