# Voice API Overview

The Nexmo Voice API is the easiest way to build high-quality voice applications in the Cloud. With the Voice API you:

* Build apps that scale with the web technologies that you are already using
* Control the flow of inbound and outbound calls in JSON with Nexmo Call Control Objects (NCCO)
* Record and store inbound or outbound calls
* Create conference calls
* Send text-to-speech messages in 23 languages with different genders and accents

In this document you can learn about:

* [Nexmo Voice API Concepts](#concepts)
* [How to Get Started with the Voice API](#getting-started)
* [Voice API Features](#voice-api-features)
* [References](#references)
* [Tutorials](#tutorials)

## Concepts

* **Authentication with JWTs** - interaction with the Voice API are authenticated using JWTs. The [Nexmo libraries](/tools) handle JWT generation using a unique Nexmo Voice Application ID and a Private Key. For more information on see [Authenticating your applications](/concepts/guides/authentication)
* **Nexmo Voice Applications** - Nexmo Voice Applications represent a one-to-one mapping with the application that you are building. They contain configuration such virtual numbers and webhook callback URLs. You can create Nexmo Voice Applications using the [Nexmo CLI](/tools) or the [Application API](/concepts/guides/applications)
* **Webhooks** - when any event takes place relating to your Nexmo application HTTP callbacks are made to your application web server so that you can act upon them. For example, when an inbound call is made to a number associated with your Nexmo application.
* **NCCOs** - Nexmo Call Control Objects are a set of actions that instruct the Nexmo how to control call to your Nexmo application. For example, you can `connect` a call, send synthesized speech using `talk`, `stream` audio, or `record` a call. They are represented in JSON form as an Array of objects. For more information see the [NCCO Reference](/voice/guides/ncco-reference) and [NCCO guide](/voice/guides/ncco).

## Getting Started

### Voice Playground

In the [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), you can try out the Voice API interactively in the Voice Playground. Once you are [signed up for a Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/signup), you can go to [Voice Playground](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/playground) in the Dashboard (Voice ‣ Voice Playgrounds).

When you use the Voice Playgrounds, you will be guided through the process of buying a phone number and assigning it to the Playground, then you can interactively test NCCOs in the browser and see the results. Playgrounds also has a number of common use cases as examples you can try. These are listed below with links to guides and tutorials on how to implement them yourself.

* Connecting two users ([guide](/voice/voice-api/guides/connect-two-users), [tutorial](/tutorials/private-voice-communication))
* Interactive Voice Response (IVR) using DTMF tones ([guide](/voice/voice-api/guides/interactive-voice-response), [tutorial](/tutorials/interactive-voice-response))
* Conference Call ([guide](/voice/voice-api/guides/create-conferences))
* Send audio to call ([NCCO reference](/api/voice/ncco#stream), [API reference](/api/voice#stream))

More details are available in this blog post: [Meet Voice Playground, Your Testing Sandbox for Nexmo Voice Apps](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/12/12/voice-playground-testing-sandbox-nexmo-voice-apps/)


### Using the Nexmo CLI tool

Before you begin:

* Sign up for a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/signup)
* Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

> *Note*: If you do not wish to install Node in order to use the [Nexmo CLI](/tools) you can also create applications using the [Application API](/concepts/guides/applications)*

Once you have installed NodeJS, you can install and setup the Nexmo CLI (Command Line Interface) as follows:

```bash
$ npm install -g nexmo-cli
```

*Note: depending on your system setup you may need to prefix the above command with `sudo`*

Using your Nexmo `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`, available from the [dashboard getting started page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide), you now setup the CLI with these credentials.

```bash
$ nexmo setup API_KEY API_SECRET
```

### Create a Nexmo Voice Application

Create a Nexmo Voice Application within the Nexmo platform to contain configuration such as associated virtual numbers and webhook callback URLs.

```bash
$ nexmo app:create 'First Voice App' --type voice https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/first_call_talk.json https://example.com/events --keyfile private.key
```

The output of the `app:create` command contains:

* The ID of your Nexmo Voice Application
* The location of the `private.key`

```bash
Application created: 635c2797-9295-4cdf-9232-d275f75ff096
Private Key saved to: private.key
```

Both of these are required to interact with the Nexmo Voice API.

For more information on the `app:create` command run `nexmo app:create --help` in your terminal or console.

### Make a Text-to-Speech Call

In the examples replace `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`, `APPLICATION_ID`, `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `TO_NUMBER` and `FROM_NUMBER` with real values.

```

## Voice API Features

The Nexmo Voice API provides features which are actioned in one of two ways:

1. Through a call to the [Voice REST API](/api/voice)
2. By returning [NCCOs](/voice/guides/ncco-reference) from your app server webhook endpoints

The following table shows the features available and how are achieved.

Action + Guide | NCCO | API
-- | -- | --
[Create outbound calls](/voice/guides/outbound-calls) | | [`POST /calls`](/api/voice#create-an-outbound-call) |
[Accept inbound calls](/voice/guides/inbound-calls) | See [Nexmo Call Control Objects](/voice/guides/ncco) |
Retrieve all call information | | [`GET /calls`](/api/voice#call_retrieve)
Retrieve information for a call | | [`GET /calls/{uuid}`](/api/voice#call_retrieve_single)
End an in-progress call | | [`PUT /calls/{uuid}`](/api/voice#call_modify_single)
