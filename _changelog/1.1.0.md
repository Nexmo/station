## Launching Nexmo Developer

After releasing [v1.0.0](#introducing-nexmo-developer) we reviewed the site for any changes that were required before Nexmo Developer could become our canonical source of documentation for our platform. We created a GitHub [milestone](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-developer/milestone/2?closed=1) to track these issues thorough to completion. Here's a brief outline of the major changes:

- **Search** - With [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) we added the ability to search across Nexmo Developer and our [Knowledgebase](https://help.nexmo.com)
- **IA Tweaks** - API references are now shown alongside the product in Documentation
- **Contribute** - The start of a new [Contribute page](/contribute) listing various ways you can get involved with Nexmo Developer & Suggest an edit links to content pages making it easy to find the documentation source.
- **Changelog** - Added this changelog page... how very meta.
- **Bugs and content tweaks** - Fixed several bugs and improved content throughout Nexmo Developer
